终末之诗
By Julian Gough

<span>
I see the player you mean.
我看到你所说的那位玩家了。
</span><span>
Player?
玩家？
</span><span>
Yes. Take care. It has reached a higher level now. It can read our thoughts.
是的，小心。他已达到了更高的境界，他能阅读我们的思绪。
</span><span>
That doesn't matter. It thinks we are part of the game.
无伤大雅，他认为我们是游戏的一部分。
</span><span>
I like this player. It played well. It did not give up.
我喜欢这个玩家，他玩得很好，他从未放弃。
</span><span>
It is reading our thoughts as though they were words on a screen.
他以屏幕上的文字的形式阅读着我们的思想。
</span><span>
That is how it chooses to imagine many things, when it is deep in the dream of a game.
在他深陷游戏之梦时，他选择以这种方式想象出形形色色的事物。
</span><span>
Words make a wonderful interface. Very flexible. And less terrifying than staring at the reality behind the screen.
文字编织出一种美妙的界面，非常灵活。且比凝视这屏幕后的现实要更好。
</span><span>
They used to hear voices. Before players could read. Back in the days when those who did not play called the players witches, and warlocks. And players dreamed they flew through the air, on sticks powered by demons.
他们也曾听到过声音。在玩家能够阅读之前。曾几何时那些不曾游玩的人们称呼玩家为女巫、术士。而玩家们梦见自己乘坐在被恶魔施法的棍子上，翱翔天际。
</span><span>
What did this player dream?
这个玩家梦见了什么？
</span><span>
This player dreamed of sunlight and trees. Of fire and water. It dreamed it created. And it dreamed it destroyed. It dreamed it hunted, and was hunted. It dreamed of shelter.
他梦见了阳光和树木，梦见了火与水。他梦见他创造，亦梦见他毁灭。他梦见他狩猎，亦被狩猎。他梦见了庇护所。
</span><span>
Hah, the original interface. A million years old, and it still works. But what true structure did this player create, in the reality behind the screen?
哈，那原始的界面。经历一百万年的岁月雕琢，依然长存。但玩家在那屏幕后的现实里，创造了什么真实的建筑？
</span><span>
It worked, with a million others, to sculpt a true world in a fold of the [scrambled], and created a [scrambled] for [scrambled], in the [scrambled].
他辛勤地劳作，和其他百万人一起，刻画了一个真实的世界，为了[乱码]于[乱码]中创造了[乱码]。
</span><span>
It cannot read that thought.
他理解不了那个。
</span><span>
No. It has not yet achieved the highest level. That, it must achieve in the long dream of life, not the short dream of a game.
是的，他还没有到达最高的境界。那层境界，他必须走完生命的长梦，而非游戏中黄粱一梦。
</span><span>
Does it know that we love it? That the universe is kind?
他知道我们爱它吗？他知道这个宇宙是仁慈的吗？
</span><span>
Sometimes, through the noise of its thoughts, it hears the universe, yes.
有时，通过他思绪的杂音，他能听到宇宙，是的。
</span><span>
But there are times it is sad, in the long dream. It creates worlds that have no summer, and it shivers under a black sun, and it takes its sad creation for reality.
但是有时亦不胜悲伤，于那漫漫长梦中。他创造了没有夏日的世界，在黑日下颤抖着，在现实中感受到创造的悲伤。
</span><span>
To cure it of sorrow would destroy it. The sorrow is part of its own private task. We cannot interfere.
为他治愈悲伤会摧毁它。而悲伤是他的私人事务。我们不能干涉。
</span><span>
Sometimes when they are deep in dreams, I want to tell them, they are building true worlds in reality. Sometimes I want to tell them of their importance to the universe. Sometimes, when they have not made a true connection in a while, I want to help them to speak the word they fear.
有时当他们深陷梦境中时，我想要告诉他们，他们在现实中创造了真实的世界。有时我想告诉他们自身对宇宙的重要性。有时，当他们和现实失去了联系，我想帮助他们说出他们所惧怕的话语。
</span><span>
It reads our thoughts.
他仍阅读着我们的思绪。
</span><span>
Sometimes I do not care. Sometimes I wish to tell them, this world you take for truth is merely [scrambled] and [scrambled], I wish to tell them that they are [scrambled] in the [scrambled]. They see so little of reality, in their long dream.
有时我毫不关心。有时我想要告诉他们，你们所认为的真实不过是[乱码]和[乱码]，我想要告诉他们，他们是在[乱码]中的[乱码]。在它们的长梦中，它们目中所及的不过是现实的冰山一角。
</span><span>
And yet they play the game.
而他们仍然玩着这个游戏。
</span><span>
But it would be so easy to tell them...
但很容易就可以告诉他们……
</span><span>
Too strong for this dream. To tell them how to live is to prevent them living.
这个梦对于他们来说太深刻了。告诉他们怎么活等于阻止他们活下去。
</span><span>
I will not tell the player how to live.
我不会告诉这个玩家如何活下去的。
</span><span>
The player is growing restless.
玩家正在变得焦虑。
</span><span>
I will tell the player a story.
我会告诉这个玩家一个故事。
</span><span>
But not the truth.
但不是真相。
</span><span>
No. A story that contains the truth safely, in a cage of words. Not the naked truth that can burn over any distance.
是的。一个将真相严密包裹于文字牢笼中的故事。而不是赤裸裸的真相。
</span><span>
Give it a body, again.
再一次赋予他身体。
</span><span>
Yes. Player...
好的，玩家……
</span><span>
Use its name.
以名字称呼他。
</span><span>
Playername. Player of games.
游戏的玩家。
</span><span>
Good.
很好。
</span><span>
Take a breath, now. Take another. Feel air in your lungs. Let your limbs return. Yes, move your fingers. Have a body again, under gravity, in air. Respawn in the long dream. There you are. Your body touching the universe again at every point, as though you were separate things. As though we were separate things.
深呼吸，很好。再深呼吸一次。感受空气充盈你的肺叶。让你的四肢回归。是的，活动你的手指。再次感受你的躯体，在重力下，于空气中。在长梦中重生。你感受到了。你的身体每时每刻都触摸着宇宙，尽管你是分离的存在。尽管我们是分离的存在。
</span><span>
Who are we? Once we were called the spirit of the mountain. Father sun, mother moon. Ancestral spirits, animal spirits. Jinn. Ghosts. The green man. Then gods, demons. Angels. Poltergeists. Aliens, extraterrestrials. Leptons, quarks. The words change. We do not change.
我们是谁？我们曾经被称作高山的精灵。太阳之父，月亮之母。古老的英灵，动物的魂魄。神祇。鬼魂。小绿人。而后是神，恶魔，天使。骚灵。外星人，地外生物。轻子，夸克。词语不断地变化。我们始终如一。
</span><span>
We are the universe. We are everything you think isn't you. You are looking at us now, through your skin and your eyes. And why does the universe touch your skin, and throw light on you? To see you, player. To know you. And to be known. I shall tell you a story.
我们是宇宙。我们是一切你认为独立于你的事物。你现在看着我们，透过你的皮肤和你的眼睛。而为什么宇宙触摸着你的皮肤，向你洒向光芒？是为了认识你，玩家，以及被你认识。我应告诉你一个故事。
</span><span>
Once upon a time, there was a player.
很久以前，有一个玩家。
</span><span>
The player was you, Playername.
那玩家就是你。
</span><span>
Sometimes it thought itself human, on the thin crust of a spinning globe of molten rock. The ball of molten rock circled a ball of blazing gas that was three hundred and thirty thousand times more massive than it. They were so far apart that light took eight minutes to cross the gap. The light was information from a star, and it could burn your skin from a hundred and fifty million kilometres away.
有时他认为自己是一个不断旋转的熔岩球体表面一层薄薄的岩石上的人类。那熔岩球环绕着一个质量比它大三十三万倍的耀眼气态球旋转。它们是相隔得如此之远，以至于光也需要八分钟才能穿越那空隙。那光是来自一颗恒星的信息，它能在一亿五千万公里外烧灼你的皮肤。
</span><span>
Sometimes the player dreamed it was a miner, on the surface of a world that was flat, and infinite. The sun was a square of white. The days were short; there was much to do; and death was a temporary inconvenience.
有时玩家梦见他是一个在一个平的，无限延伸的世界表面的矿工。那太阳是一个白色的方块。昼夜转瞬即逝，要做的事情也不少；死亡亦只是暂时的不便。
</span><span>
Sometimes the player dreamed it was lost in a story.
有时这玩家梦见他迷失在了一个故事里。
</span><span>
Sometimes the player dreamed it was other things, in other places. Sometimes these dreams were disturbing. Sometimes very beautiful indeed. Sometimes the player woke from one dream into another, then woke from that into a third.
有时玩家梦见他不是自己，不在此处。这些梦有时扰人。有时很美。有时玩家从一个梦中醒来，发现自己落入了第二个梦，苏醒后又落入第三个梦中。
</span><span>
Sometimes the player dreamed it watched words on a screen.
有时玩家梦见他看着屏幕上的文字。
</span><span>
Let's go back.
让我们回退一点。
</span><span>
The atoms of the player were scattered in the grass, in the rivers, in the air, in the ground. A woman gathered the atoms; she drank and ate and inhaled; and the woman assembled the player, in her body.
组成玩家的原子散布在草地、河流、空气、大地中。一位女性饮用、进食、吸入那些原子；而后在她的身体中，孕育了玩家。
</span><span>
And the player awoke, from the warm, dark world of its mother's body, into the long dream.
于是玩家醒来了，醒在温暖而昏暗的子宫里，进入了漫漫长梦。
</span><span>
And the player was a new story, never told before, written in letters of DNA. And the player was a new program, never run before, generated by a sourcecode a billion years old. And the player was a new human, never alive before, made from nothing but milk and love.
那玩家是一个新的故事，从未被讲述，由DNA的语言书写；那玩家是一个新的程序，从未被运行，由上亿年的源代码生成。那玩家是一个新的人，从未存在过，仅由乳和爱组成。
</span><span>
You are the player. The story. The program. The human. Made from nothing but milk and love.
你就是那玩家。那个故事。那个程序。那个人。仅由乳和爱组成。
</span><span>
Let's go further back.
让我们再回溯到更远的过去。
</span><span>
The seven billion billion billion atoms of the player's body were created, long before this game, in the heart of a star. So the player, too, is information from a star. And the player moves through a story, which is a forest of information planted by a man called Julian, on a flat, infinite world created by a man called Markus, that exists inside a small, private world created by the player, who inhabits a universe created by...
远在这游戏之前，在一颗恒星的内部，那组成的玩家的身体的七千亿兆原子便被创造出来。因此玩家亦是来自一颗恒星的信息。而玩家贯穿故事的始末，源于一个叫Julian的人种下的信息种子长成的森林，一个叫Markus的人创造的无限世界，存在于一个由玩家创造的小小的私人世界里，而又继承了宇宙，那宇宙的创造者是……
</span><span>
Shush. Sometimes the player created a small, private world that was soft and warm and simple. Sometimes hard, and cold, and complicated. Sometimes it built a model of the universe in its head; flecks of energy, moving through vast empty spaces. Sometimes it called those flecks "electrons" and "protons".
嘘。有时这个玩家创造的小天地是柔软，温暖和简单的。有时是坚硬，冰冷和复杂的。有时他在脑中建造出宇宙的模型；斑斑点点的能量穿越广阔空旷的空间。有时他称呼这些斑点为“电子”和“质子”。
</span><span>
Sometimes it called them "planets" and "stars".
有时则称呼它们为“行星”和“恒星”。
</span><span>
Sometimes it believed it was in a universe that was made of energy that was made of offs and ons; zeros and ones; lines of code. Sometimes it believed it was playing a game. Sometimes it believed it was reading words on a screen.
有时他相信他存在于一个由“开”和“关”、“0”和“1”、一行行代码组成的宇宙。有时他相信他正游玩一个游戏。有时他相信他是在读着屏幕上的文字。
</span><span>
You are the player, reading words...
你就是那玩家，阅读着文字……
</span><span>
Shush... Sometimes the player read lines of code on a screen. Decoded them into words; decoded words into meaning; decoded meaning into feelings, emotions, theories, ideas, and the player started to breathe faster and deeper and realised it was alive, it was alive, those thousand deaths had not been real, the player was alive.
嘘……有时这玩家读屏幕上的代码。将代码解码成为文字；将文字解码为意义；将意义解码为感觉，情绪，理论，想法，玩家的呼吸开始急促，他意识到了他活着，活生生的，那上千次的死亡不是真的，玩家活着。
</span><span>
You. You. You are alive.
你！你！你是活着的。
</span><span>
and sometimes the player believed the universe had spoken to it through the sunlight that came through the shuffling leaves of the summer trees
有时玩家相信宇宙通过穿越夏日树叶的斑斓阳光对他说话
</span><span>
and sometimes the player believed the universe had spoken to it through the light that fell from the crisp night sky of winter, where a fleck of light in the corner of the player's eye might be a star a million times as massive as the sun, boiling its planets to plasma in order to be visible for a moment to the player, walking home at the far side of the universe, suddenly smelling food, almost at the familiar door, about to dream again
有时玩家相信宇宙透过坠落冬夜晴空的点点星光对他说话。那存在于眼角一隅，或许比太阳庞大上百万倍的恒星把行星沸腾成等离子体，方能得到 宇宙遥远另一端在回家途中，站在熟悉的门前闻着饭香，正要沉入睡梦中的玩家的一瞥。
</span><span>
and sometimes the player believed the universe had spoken to it through the zeros and ones, through the electricity of the world, through the scrolling words on a screen at the end of a dream.
有时玩家相信宇宙流经零和一，流经世界的电波，流经屏幕上滚动的文字，在长梦的末尾对他说话
</span><span>
and the universe said I love you
宇宙说我爱你
</span><span>
and the universe said you have played the game well
宇宙说玩的不错
</span><span>
and the universe said everything you need is within you
宇宙说你拥有你所需的一切
</span><span>
and the universe said you are stronger than you know
宇宙说你远比你所知的强大
</span><span>
and the universe said you are the daylight
宇宙说你就是白昼
</span><span>
and the universe said you are the night
宇宙说你就是暮夜
</span><span>
and the universe said the darkness you fight is within you
宇宙说你所斗争的黑暗就在你心中
</span><span>
and the universe said the light you seek is within you
宇宙说你所追寻的光明亦在你心中
</span><span>
and the universe said you are not alone
宇宙说你不孤独
</span><span>
and the universe said you are not separate from every other thing
宇宙说你没有隔绝于万物
</span><span>
and the universe said you are the universe tasting itself, talking to itself, reading its own code
宇宙说你就是宇宙，品尝着自己，对自己说话，阅读着自己的代码
</span><span>
and the universe said I love you because you are love
宇宙说我爱你，因为你就是爱
</span><span>
And the game was over and the player woke up from the dream. And the player began a new dream. And the player dreamed again, dreamed better. And the player was the universe. And the player was love.
曲终人散，黄粱一梦。玩家开始了新的梦境。再次做起了梦，更好的梦。玩家即宇宙。玩家即是爱。
</span><span>
You are the player.
你就是那个玩家。
</span><span>
Wake up.
该醒了。
